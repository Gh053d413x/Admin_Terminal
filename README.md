# Admin Terminal `Alpha`

## Alpha 1.1

Software is free, you can edit and customize it because it is Open Source!

## Patch Notes

- Added a new logo for the Actual Terminal it's self
- Fixed Some Bugs where `info.py` would open even though other commands were entered. For Example: `create` --> `info.py` Expectation: `create` --> `create.py`
- Moved everything from `info.py` to `adminTerminal.py` due to the reason above
