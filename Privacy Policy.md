## Collecting and Using of Your Personal Data

### Types of Data Collected

#### Personal Data

I do not collect any personal data when you use the Service. I only collect personal data when you voluntarily provide such information to me, such as when you contact me via email or through the Service or through GitHub's issue system.

As stated in the README file, the service only stores data locally on your device. This means that any data you input or generate while using the Service is stored on your own device and is not transmitted to any external servers or databases.

I am a single developer and I have no intention of collecting or storing any personal data from users. The Service is intended to be used in a way that respects user privacy and does not require any personal information.

#### Usage Data

I do not collect any usage data when you use the Service. The Service is designed to be used without the need for usage information.

As stated in the README file, the service only stores data locally on your device. This means that any data you input or generate while using the Service is stored on your own device and is not transmitted to any external servers or databases.

I am a single developer and I have no intention of collecting or storing any usage data from users. The Service is intended to be used in a way that respects user privacy and does not require any usage information.

Be aware that when I release the Beta branch of the Service, I may collect usage data to improve the Service and provide a better user experience. This usage data will be collected in accordance with this Privacy Policy and will be used solely for the purpose of improving the Service.

This only happens when you voluntarily provide such information to me, such as when you contact me via email or through the Service. The information you provide may include:

- Your OS
- Your Browser
- OS/Browser Version

__Only in a bug report__

### Usage, Performance and Miscellaneous
I may use a third-party Service Provider to maintain and improve my Service.

__Github__

I use GitHub as a code repository and issue tracker for the Service. When you create an issue or comment on an issue, your GitHub username and any information you provide in the issue or comment will be visible to me and other users of the Service. This information is publicly accessible on GitHub and is subject to GitHub's privacy policy.

The code is open source and available on GitHub, which means that anyone can view the code and contribute to it. However, I do not collect any personal data from users of the Service, and I do not have access to any personal data that you may have stored on your device.

The evidence of me not collecting any personal data is in the source code of the Service, which is available on GitHub. The source code does not contain any code that collects or transmits personal data to any external servers or databases.

Most info is stored locally on your device, so I do not have access to any personal data that you may have stored on your device. The Service is designed to be used in a way that respects user privacy and does not require any personal information.

## Children's Privacy

My Service does not address anyone under the age of 13. I do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from anyone under the age of 13. If you are a parent or guardian and you are aware that Your child has provided me with Personal Data, if it is necessary, contact me. If I become aware that I have collected Personal Data from anyone under the age of 13 without verification of parental consent, it is only being stored locally on your device and be aware that your child just submitted a bug report, there isn't really much I can do about it, Github manages all of the issues and bug reports, I can delete the issue if it has to come to that, but I can assure you that I will not use that information for any purpose other than to fix the bug.

All personal data collected by the Service is stored locally on your device and is not transmitted to any external servers or databases. This means that I do not have access to any personal data collected by the Service, and I cannot delete it, same with the GitHub issue tracker.
